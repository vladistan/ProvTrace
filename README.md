Call watcher is an injectable libraray that lets you monitor certain
activity performed by a running process.  It is useful when you do
not have the ability to modify the program you wish to monitor.

This project is a compilation of my Linux and Solaris project from
late 1990s early 2000s.  Quite a lot have changed since then,  so
here is a modern version of the library.

There are two parts in this project.   First is the version of the
library for Linux, second is the version for MacOS.  Each part has
its own Makefile and test.sh script that contains example how to
use this library.
